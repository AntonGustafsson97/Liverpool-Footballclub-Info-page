                    <h3>Kenny Dalglish (1977-1990)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Known as "King Kenny" among the Anfield faithful,
                        Kenny Dalglish was a genius on the pitch and is one of the most
                        respected figures in Liverpool's history. Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool
                        in 1985 after the resignation of Joe Fagan, winning a further three First
                        Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991.

                    <h3>Steven Gerrard (1991-2015)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Steven Gerrard is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation and is
                        undoubtedly
                        one of Liverpool's greatest-ever players.
                        Known for his leadership, passion, and exceptional ability, Gerrard carried the team
                        through many challenging periods.

                    <h3>Mohamed Salah (2017-Present)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Despite still playing for Liverpool, Mohamed Salah is undeniably one of the greatest
                        players in the club's history.
                        Since joining in 2017, he's been nothing short of sensational.
                        His combination of pace, skill, and clinical finishing has seen him break numerous records,
                        including scoring the most
                        goals in a 38-game Premier League season, until that record was broken by Erling Haaland this
                        year.

                <h3>Ian Rush (1980-1986) & (1988-1996)</h3>
                <p>
                    Ian Rush is Liverpool's all-time leading goalscorer, a testament to his clinical finishing and
                    tireless work rate.
                    Rush's combination of pace, intelligence, and predatory instincts made him a constant threat to
                    defenders. During his
                    two spells at the club, Rush scored an impressive 346 goals, helping Liverpool secure numerous
                    domestic and European
                    honours.

                <h3>Luis Suarez (1991-2015)</h3>

                <p>
                    Despite only spending three and a half seasons at Anfield,
                    Luis Suarez left an indelible mark on the club. The Uruguayan
                    forward combined sublime skills with an insatiable desire to win,
                    and his performances during the 2013-14 season are
                    still talked about with awe by Liverpool fans.

                <h3>Jamie Carragher (1996-2013)</h3>

                <p>
                    Jamie Carragher epitomised loyalty, passion, and commitment during his 17-year stint
                    with Liverpool, symbolising just
                    how much it meant to wear the famous red shirt. Carragher was a versatile defender,
                    capable of playing across the
                    backline, but it was at centre-back where he excelled. Known for his tenacity,
                    leadership, and excellent reading of the
                    game, Carragher was a stalwart in Liverpool's defence.
