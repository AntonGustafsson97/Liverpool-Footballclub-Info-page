                    <p>
                        Known as "King Kenny" among the Anfield faithful,
                        Kenny Dalglish was a genius on the pitch and is one of the most
                        respected figures in Liverpool's history.

                    <h3>Steven Gerrard (1991-2015)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Steven Gerrard is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation and is
                        undoubtedly
                        one of Liverpool's greatest-ever players.
                        Known for his leadership, passion, and exceptional ability, Gerrard carried the team
                        through many challenging periods.

                    <h3>Mohamed Salah (2017-Present)</h3>

                    <p>
                        Despite still playing for Liverpool, Mohamed Salah is undeniably one of the greatest
                        players in the club's history.
                        Since joining in 2017, he's been nothing short of sensational.
                        His combination of pace, skill, and clinical finishing has seen him break numerous records,
                        including scoring the most
                        goals in a 38-game Premier League season, until that record was broken by Erling Haaland this
                        year.
